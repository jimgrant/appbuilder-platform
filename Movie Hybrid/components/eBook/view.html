                    <div style="padding:1em">
                        Let us begin with an overview of the anatomy of a simple roman shade system. There will be more complex fabric assemblies described later (some made up of two layers of fabric — a facing and a lining or backing layer and some utilizing more complicated rib and lift line systems), but the principles of the roman shade system remain the same.
                        ! Simple Inside Mounted, Unlined Roman Shade (Viewed from the Inside)
                        There will always be a headboard. This board is attached to the wall or window frame at the top of the shade. Along its front edge a strip of Velcro tape is stapled or tacked. A matching Velcro tape sewn to the top of the fabric construction secures the shade in place. Each shade will be divided into several “segments”. The depth of the segments determine how the shade will fold. Segments will often have ribs secured at their lower edge that, when drawn up by cords from above, sandwich that segment and the one above it together creating a fold in the shade. Each pair of segments as it is folded from the bottom up, tucks up under the segments that are folded above. It should be noted here that ribs are optional. There may be none or they can be used on alternate segments as illustrated above or they can be placed at every segment line. Using ribs encourages more uniformity as the folds are created but and gives the shade a somewhat more formal “tailored” appearance.
                        ! The cords are tied into rings at the top of the bottom-most segment, or “bottom curtain”. These cords are run through rings on at the top of alternate segments (segment pairs) above up to the headboard where they are put through fairleads or eyes and led to one or the other side and made adjustable with a “cord lock”. There will be several cords depending on the width of the shade. These are usually combined a foot or so below the cord lock into a single cord with a “condenser”— that makes it easy to raise the shade with consistency from side to side (an attractive alternative is to braid the cord lines together into a single strand). The Shade Above from the Outside
                        There is a weight batten (often a metal rod) in a sleeve at the bottom of the shade. There will also be hems or other ?nishing techniques employed along the sides of the shade and along its top. Fabric for all of these ?nished edges must be provided for. The discussion thus far has centered on a very simple roman shade. This style is generally referred to as “classic” or “?at” or “plain”. There are many variations on this design. A Pintrest post by Keenan Kreations that follows is itself not by any means complete, but it does suggest the breadth of that variety.
                        !
                        Our purpose here is to provide a foundation that will make it possible to build any roman shade without actually going into speci?c detail on every possible variation. To accomplish that we will carefully consider the construction of just four “styles” of roman shade: ?at, hobbled, slatted, and tucked. The contention is that, knowing how to build these four, all the rest are possible with minor modi?cation that is self evident. Moreover, we will focus entirely on the materials and construction techniques that we consider “normal”. There are alternatives to almost everything we say and do, but we will ignore them here. The goal is the creation of beautiful shades as quickly and inexpensively as possible. The alternatives can be applied as desired on a case by case basis. Let’s review these four styles of roman shade: CLASSIC OR FLAT OR PLAIN ROMAN SHADES This type is by far and away the most common. We have already noted that ribs are optional. The simple shade that we have described above with ribs on alternate segments could be designated a “soft fold” design If ribs were totally absent and the shade be drawn up with two lift cords from the edges, it might be described as “relaxed” or “swaged”. If the two lift cords were spaced in somewhat from the sides,“relaxed with wings” or “balloon royal” might be used in reference. If the segment folds were permanently sewn in place preventing easy adjustment, the shade would be considered “faux” or “false”. If vertical folds were set into the face of the shade, it might be described as “ruf?ed”, “pleated” or “relaxed with box pleats”. These terms are all widely used. They are helpful but hardly precise. It is important to note that all the above shade varieties share the basic characteristics of the simple classic roman shade with minor modi?cations.
                        HOBBLED ROMAN SHADES When the segments in a roman shade are secured so that they do not fully unfold, they are said to be “hobbled”. If the restraints are moderate in depth, say less than 50% of segment depth, then they are sometimes designated “teardrop” shades. More extreme hobbles will create fuller shades that some call “looped”. Each of these can be considered mem
                        bers of the same “style” because they share construction techniques. And all members of this style feature segments that fold individually over themselves unlike the classic shade above where the folds take place over segment pairs (where one folds forward and one backward).
                        !
                        SLATTED ROMAN SHADES Some would say that slatted shades also share these characteristics and should be treated together with the hobbled shades. There is some signi?cant variation, however. Horizontal pockets are sewn in place at each segment so that narrow “slats” can be inserted in the resulting sleeves. Here, again, just as with the hobbled shade described above, each segment is folded individually. The result has been described as
                        Hobbled and Slatted Shades
                        yielding “a sleek, contemporary look.” (p. 47 of Windows With Style) The resulting shades are often considered “banded”. TUCKED ROMAN SHADES It is not unusual to encounter shades where segment folds are sharply creased with relatively narrow (usually 3/8 inch (9.5 mm)) horizontal pleats or “tucks” sewn in place at each fold. In this case, half of the tucks face the front of the shade and half face the back. The cords that raise the shade will be secured only on the back facing tucks. So, like the classic shade, each fold consists of a pair. Such shades fold neatly just like an accordion. They yield an extremely ?nished or tailored look. Ribs are often not used here to further this smooth, polished look. These “styles” are just variations on a theme. That is, they all share the essential structure that we have discussed so far. Even so, it makes sense to create independent chapters for each style. There will be some duplication but the likelihood of confusion will be reduced. With the same goal in mind, that is reduction of confusion, we will focus entirely on the materials and construction techniques that we consider “normal”.

                    <span class="k-link"><b>Chapter 2 -- Measurements and Rules</b></span>
                    <div style="padding:1em">
                        Measurements are dependent on whether the shade is to be mounted inside a window moulding or outside. The width of an outside mounted shade will not be limited by the window frame opening. It can be any width dependent only on aesthetic considerations. The headboard in an outside mount will normally be just thick enough (“thick” here refers to projection from the wall) to make the shade hang clear of whatever is below it and no thicker. This will assure that it will remain effective in blocking light at the sides of the shade. An outside mounted roman shade can be installed well above window frames, if desired, so that the shade, when drawn up, will reveal the entire window. Shades mounted inside window frames will generally be just slightly narrower (between 1/4 and 1/2 inch — 6.35 to 12.7 mm — on each side) than the space inside the frame. The thickness of the headboard  and the depth of the frame itself will determine how deep the shade rests within the frame. The headboard will usually be from 1/4 to 2/3 the width of the frame in thickness by 0.75 to 1 inch (19 to 25 mm) along what will become its forward surface (a one x one or a one x two often works well). Lets boldly set forth rules for measuring, cutting, and assembling a roman shade. If these rules are followed, pleasing results will follow. That does not mean that these rules are the only ones that could be employed. Indeed, almost anything “works”, but the rules that we have developed over the course of much experimentation provide beautiful and functional roman shades every time. This may seem a bit daunting, but don’t despair. We will follow with a discussion of the roman shade calculator that is accessed with the second tab below. The calculator makes the application of all these rules quite straight forward. 1. The facing fabric (the one everyone sees on the inside shade surface) should be cut to a width equal to the desired ?nished width plus
                        3 inches (76.2 mm). The extra allows for 1.5 inch (38.1 mm) on each side. This extra will be used for hems and any necessary ?nishing seams. If two or more panels are necessary along the shade’s width, there should be a 1 inch (24.5 mm) seam allowance (2 overlapping widths 1/2 inch wide) for each additional panel added to this basic width. If the fabric width is insuf?cient, we like to create an extra panel on each side of the central one to keep seams centered which would require an additional 2 inches (49 mm) of width beyond the actual shade width with its edge allowances. 2. The length of the facing fabric should be suf?cient to create the desired ?nished length plus 10 inches (127 mm). This extra allows for a ?nishing sleeve on the bottom of the shade and a proper ?nishing hem at the top. If two or more panels are necessary along the shade’s length (only likely if the shade length is run across the width of the fabric), there should be a 1 inch (24.5 mm) seam allowance (2 overlapping widths 1/2 inch wide) for each additional panel added to this basic length. (And here, again, we will suggest a central panel with extra at the top and the bottom just as above when the same problem confronted us because of fabric width constraints.) 3. If there is to be a lining, it should be cut the desired ?nished width (it will thus be 3 inches —. 76.2 mm) narrower than the cut facing fabric). This will insure that it remains hidden on the back side of the shade. 4. If there is a lining, its length should be exactly the same as the that of the ?nished shade. 5. A rough approximation of the depth of the “valance” will be used to determine the spacing of segments in the shade. This valance is  roughly the depth of the highest fold of fabric when the shade is fully retracted. The value decided upon here “seeds” our formula with the preferred depth of the valance, but the ?nal depth is dependent on the length of the shade as well and the seed will be modi?ed somewhat in the course of applying the rules that follow. Even so, the value of the seed will have an impact upon pleat depth in any given shade length. To determine the seed value, we normally divide
                        the length of the shade by 6.5 segments in hobbled and slatted shades where each segment folds on itself and 11.5 segments in the case of ?at and tucked shades that make use of paired segments in each fold. The result is rounded to an integer value. The resulting valance seed normally ranges from between 2 inches (49 mm) as an absolute minimum and 18 inches (441 mm). This number can be modi?ed. Use lower numbers to reduce the depth of segments (and to create more “child safe” shade systems). Larger seeds increase segment depth and reduce the volume of folds in the collapsed shade. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recommends that there be no exposed cords, but, if this is not possible, they recommend that the loops of cord that can be formed when roman shade segments are extended be as small as possible. Indeed, qualifying for ANSI safety compliance would require the minimum 2 inch valance depth. But the folds will be small and tight. We use shroud tape in all that follows to encapsulate the cords making this requirement unnecessary. 6. Divide the length of the ?nished shade by the valance depth desired and round the result up or down to a whole number. If that number is odd, you are done. If it is not, then add 1 to it to make it odd. The result is the the number of segments for the shade in question. 7. Divide the ?nished length of the shade less 1.5 inches (36.75 mm) by the number of segments (the odd number derived in the step above). The result is the depth of all the segments save the bottom one. Label these the “main segments”. 8. Add the 1.5 inches (36.75 mm) subtracted just above to the bottom segment so that it will hang down just a bit from the stack of pleats above giving a ?nished look. This is the “curtain segment”. The curtain segment can be increased or decreased to ensure that the length of the ?nished shade matches expectations (when inches are ?gured to two decimal places, rounding to the nearest eighth inch, a perfectly acceptable procedure, can require minor adjustments to the curtain segment depth).
                        To all of this must be added the possibility that the fabric may have patterns that repeat vertically, horizontally or both. Care must be taken to place these patterns. They will normally be centered on each shade horizontally. If vertical patterns exist, the intention of most designers will be to keep them consistent in neighboring shades.  Of course, pattern repeats cannot be accommodated unless their values are known. With a little study, it is possible to determine the beginning and ending points in a patterned fabric but, fortunately, this effort is seldom necessary since the measurements are readily available from whatever fabric outlet is used. Sailrite displays them under the “description” listing for each fabric. If one or both repeats are missing, that means that there is no pattern (at least no discernible pattern) in that direction.?

                    <div style="padding:1em">
                        Whew! All this is simple enough, but there is a lot of it. The roman shade calculator (the second tab below) makes all of this easy and fast. The calculator started as a simple program to give yardage ordering information. But it has evolved into an extremely sophisticated tool which will not only calculate yardage but also show a rendering of the of the panels needed to complete a project and the segment sizes and ring placement for roman shades. If there are pattern repeats in the fabric (horizontal and/or vertical) the software will show how to center them and keep them consistent over two or more shades. The renditions are very accurate, but some assumptions for seams and hems and lining and segmentation are made — more about this in the following paragraphs.
                        SEGMENT DEPTH One of the most important functions of the calculator is its facility in experimenting with different valance seed depths. The valance segment depth as modi?ed by rounding the number of segments depending on shade length will determine the actual depth of the top fold that creates the valance. Each fold below the ?rst will create a fold that will hang down an additional 0.5 to 1 inch (12.7 to 25.4 mm) — depending upon how neatly the rings and ribs stack upon one another). And the bottom curtain segment will add roughly 1.5 more inches (36.75 mm) to the total when drawn all the way up.
                        !
                        Let’s use the simple inside mounted shade with which we started this book as an example. The inputs are as shown above (the iPhone screen will have the same input ?elds but they will be in a single, longer column). The quantity defaults to 1 prior to any entry. The valance seed defaults to 4 inches when the length value is entered. This particular fabric has a horizontal repeat of 3.74 inches (95 mm). Touch the “mminches” switch to convert everything to millimeters if preferred. The seed value becomes 101 — less rounding error than the imperial result but both are perfectly usable. When the calculate button is hit, the following screen scrolls up into view.
                        The iPad Screen for the Simple Inside Mounted Shade in the Initial Illustrations Above
                        !
                        The “calculated measurements” list 11 segments (6 pairs and a bottom curtain). The valance seed results in a bottom segment of 5 inches with main segments at 4 inches. (Note that, when decimals result, the measurements are rounded to the nearest eighth inch.) If the unit switch is changed to “mm” and calculate is hit, a bottom segment of 139 mm  and main segments of 101 mm (just by chance the calculated seed value) result. Metric notation requires less rounding, but the resulting measurements are “close enough” and bottom segment depth adjustment, although somewhat greater when imperial units are employed, will make shade length exactly the same in both cases.) If the length of the shade were increased to 56 inches, the seed value would default to 5 inches (124 mm) the bottom segment would be 5  inches (162 mm) with the main segments 5 inches (126 mm) deep.  (Again, note that rounding will be slightly more pronounced with imperial units so these numbers do not match up as might be expected.)
                        The Calculator Scrollable Results Screen
                        The value of the valance seed is adjusted by default to create 11 total segments over the entire length of the shade. Depending on whether each segment pair or each segment itself creates a fold, the default seed will vary, i.e. the ?at and tucked styles yield the 11 segments here while hobbled or segmented style choices would result in a default of 7 segments. But the default seed in either case can be increased to reduced. Decreasing the seed will increase the number of segments and increase the height of the folded shade bundle while increasing it will reduce the segments and the folded height.
                        CALCULATED MEASUREMENTS The Calculated Measurements box scrolls if necessary to also show the number of lift lines recommended along with their placement intervals. The lift rings in the calculator renditions are spaced across the width of the shades.“Lift line separation” is rounded to the nearest 1/8 inch or to the nearest millimeter. The very minor effects of the rounding are accommodated by adjusting the nominal 1 inch margins at the ?nished shade edges. This line in the Calculated Measurements box is followed by the edge allowance added along each shade edge, then the length of lift line that should be obtained, and ?nally the standard 7 inch (177.8 mm) bottom edge allowance is indicated (this cannot be modi?ed in the calculator).
                        MATERIALS LIST The Materials List box also scrolls as necessary. Here are all the materials that we think most appropriate for the particular shade in question and nothing more — some are marked recommended and some are marked optional. A more complete list with alternatives and options beyond those in the calculator will be found in the following chapter.
                        PANEL RENDERING Then panel rendering scrolls into view. This is the shade “blueprint” in grey and purple. It includes dimensions for all four sides of the face or
                        “?nish” fabric. The length dimension includes an extra 3 inches (76.2 mm) to ?nish the top and 7 inches (177.8 mm) to ?nish the bottom of the shade. If the default edge allowance of 1-1/2 inches is not changed, the width will be 3 inches (76.2 mm) more than the ?nished width of the shade to allow for hems. All of this extra “?nishing fabric” is indicated with a lighter color on the rendering. The fabric in the shade described above has a horizontal pattern repeat. The pattern’s beginning and ending points are indicated with a light green line on the rendition. Because of this horizontal pattern repeat, the shade has been shifted to the right in the rendering to center it over the repeats. The margin of 8.75 inches (222.25 mm) indicates the extent of the required shift. Do note that some fabrics are not trimmed at the mill. They will have excess fabric along both edges. Discount or trim that excess away on both sides (to match the published fabric width) before using the margin to center patterns. When shades are so narrow that more than one panel can be cut from a fabric width with horizontal pattern repeats, there will be “horizontal pattern matching allowance” between the panels. And, if more than one row of panels is cut from a length of fabric with a vertical pattern repeat, there will be a “pattern matching allowanced” to separate the rows and maintain a consistent placement on that vertical grid. As an example, enter the following into the calculator: 15, 27, 1, 54, 7.813, 4.34, 1.5, Flat, 2, Length.
                        !
                        SHADES REQUIRING MORE THAN ONE FABRIC WIDTH If the “Pattern Orientation” selector is changed from the default “Length” to “Width” and “Calculate” is hit again, the calculated measurements will remain the same but the shade will be rendered with the pattern running across rather than down. Since the shade is longer than the fabric width, 3 panels are called for. The intent is to keep the central part of the shade “whole” and move seams to the ends while at the same time making sure that patterns are matched. When multiple panels are
                        Four Small Shades with Vertical and Horizontal Pattern
                        required for a shade, a seam allowance of 1 inch (25.4 mm) will be provided. This seam allowance will be indicated with 2 purple 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) bands along mating panel edges on the rendition. Such allowances will generally be located on a pattern initiation line or midway between two such lines. To accommodate the adjacent seam allowances in the two panel additions (panels 2 and 3 — we call them “remainders”), the seam allowances are offset 1 inch (25.4 mm) from this point in the primary panel. Consider the following shade: 65, 49, 1, 54, 3.74,0,1.5,Flat, 4, Length. Here the major, center, portion of the shade is a single panel. The extra width is accommodated by adding panels along each edge. These panel remainders keep the pattern centered and move seams out to the edges. Each remainder pair is centered in a pattern repeat. Their 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) seam allowances will match up properly with those on the primary panels which end 1 inch beyond the pattern center (just as was the case in the paragraph above) 1.28 inches from each fabric edge.
                        ! Fabric Width Less than Shade Width
                        The remainder panels will be sewn one on each side of the primary panel. Lay the pair to be joined on one another “face to face” (not all fabrics have a front and a back, but, if yours does, then the front sides should be facing each other). Baste the assembly together with pins or with double sided “transfer tape” (seamstick) in the seam allowance to insure accuracy. Put a row of straight stitches 1/2 inch (12.2 mm) inside the matched edges. Put down a pencil line to insure a straight line of stitches or use the Deluxe Magnetic Guide or do both — accuracy here is very important. The calculator will have added just the right amount to the segments to make this seam possible and to insure that the pattern (if any) is continuous. Then spread the seam allowances back against their parent panels. Use an iron with a safe heat setting to smooth them in place.
                        !
                        Spread the panels to check that there are no bubbles or tight spots along the seam.
                        Spreading the Seam Allowances
                        It should be noted here that the calculator is limited to working with at most 2 widths of fabric (3 panels) in the creation of any single shade. Wide shades (or long ones run across the fabric width) will always have a central panel and two bordering panels. If more than one shade is requested, all of the central panels will be rendered ?rst followed by all of the remainders.
                        USING THE LENGTH AND WIDTH SELECTOR If the pattern would look better running the shade across the width of the fabric roll, change the orientation selector from “length” to “width”. Now the remainder panels are for the top and bottom of the shade rather than for the sides. And the vertical pattern matching allowance is 1.44 inches (see the gap between the primary panel and the remainders below). The seam allowances on the remainders center on the pattern repeat just as they did above, but they could also center on the demarcation lines themselves. (Change the length to 46 inches to demonstrate this.) As before, the 1 inch seam allowance at each edge is added on both sides of the primary panel which pushes its edge out beyond the pattern repeat line or its center point as appropriate.
                        ! Since yardage can begin at any point along the length of a fabric roll, a little effort may be required in order to establish the begin point of a vertical pattern. This effort will only be necessary if the pattern is to be located at a given point. If that is desired, order a horizontal pattern length of extra material (one length no matter the quantity of shades required) so the shade outline(s) can be adjusted up and down on the cut length.
                        LINING PANELS The calculator provides the rectangular measurements for optional liner fabric on the second line of the Materials List. The width will equal the width of the ?nished shade while the length will be 3 inches longer
                        A Width Oriented Shade
                        than the ?nished length so that it can be matched at the top of the shade with the facing. The liner will be narrower than the facing fabric by the width of the two edge allowances.
                        ! Notice that there is extra material at the bottom of the shade above. This material should extend beyond the lining material 7 inches (177.8 mm) which will be used to create a facing at the bottom of the shade.
                        SUMMARY Let this serve as a brief introduction to the shade calculator. In fact, there is much more to be said about it. But much of that has to do with speci?c styles (?at, hobbled, slatted, and tucked). Separate chapters will be devoted to each style and each one of these is where relevant features of the calculator will be discussed. Needless to say, carefully check all measurements prior to cutting or ordering fabric. Do let us know if you discover a bug in the calculator. Email Eric Grant at Sailrite (ericg@sailrite.com).?

                        The shade calculator includes a list of materials. The items and their quantities are customized for the shade in question. Each list includes just the items that we normally use ourselves in the completion of those given shades. But alternative materials are possible. And specialized tools can be helpful. There follows a more inclusive list of possible materials and tools for a roman shade project. Not everything here will be required for every project. But nothing of consequence will be overlooked if each item below is considered prior to beginning work.
                        Materials List Sailrite Pt# Facing fabric (Brisa Braemore, Dena Home, P/K Lifestyles, P/ Kaufmann, Softline, Sunbrella, Tommy Bahama, Waverly, and many, many more!)

                        FACING FABRIC There is no “best” fabric for shades. Any fabric at all can be used. But there are nevertheless some characteristics that are worth looking for in the fabric you choose. Of course it must have a color and pattern that you like. In addition, it will “drape” better if it is rather soft. And durability in sunlight is quite desirable. And a fabric with a “W” cleaning code (water based cleaners can be used) will be easier to maintain.  This said, the fabric used to build the “basic” shade in the opening illustrations is Sunbrella outdoor furniture fabric that is not very soft at all. And, if the fabric you like is not rated well for ultraviolet exposure, lining can be added to protect it. And very few fabrics are rated “X” (cleaned only by vacuum or brushing) — most are capable of being spot cleaned with one or more solvents. So color and pattern are clearly the most important factors for fabric selection. Other limitations can probably be worked around.

                        All fabric cutting can be done with scissors or with a "hotknife". The latter is appropriate for synthetic fabric. It can be a soldering iron or gun with a narrow blade or it can be a specially designed professional tool (like the Sailrite Edge listed in the tools table above). The advantage in cutting a synthetic fabric with a such a tool is that the edge will be cut and sealed at the same time. Cotton, and other “natural” fabrics require cutting with a scissors. The resulting edge will not be sealed. But this is not a serious problem with shades where nearly all the raw fabric edges are ?nished. Any raveling should go unnoticed. Be careful to cut all lines as straight as possible. We will actually be using the cut edges to guide us in our ?nish work. One more caution. Synthetic fabrics do not shrink or stretch enough to warrant special treatment, but the same often cannot be said of natural fabrics. If in doubt, it is a good idea to wash and dry or steam iron cloth made of natural ?bers before fabrication.
                        LINING FABRIC Adding a lining to roman shades is optional. It is recommended if the selected fabric is not rated for outdoor UV exposure. It can also be useful to increase the insulating characteristics of the shade (although this bene?t is often oversold in ads for ?nished shades). Finally, it can help block out light. It is also possible to insert an “interlining” between the shade face fabric and a lining. This is sometimes done to add bulk to draperies, but we do not believe that is necessary or desirable in roman shades that should collapse neatly. As a result, the instructions that follow will describe construction with lining and without, but no mention of a third layer of interlining will be made. If room darkening is desired, use one of the Softline Suite blackout drapery color choices. Otherwise, for protection from UV, the best choice is Softline drapery lining material also available in several colors.
                        !
                        THREAD The choice of thread used is not critical. Polyester thread does have excellent UV resistance, but color matching is often more important in shades than the durability of stitching. That is why we list the clear mono?lament #18 thread above even though it is nylon and thus more susceptible to UV damage. In many cases there will be very little exposed thread in a roman shade. We do our best to reduce that exposure in the instructions following. Some even go so far as to eliminate sewing entirely — using iron on adhesive instead. But, at Sailrite, we are not yet willing to give up the certainty of stitching.
                        RIBS AND WEIGHT BARS Plastic ribs are wonderful. They are inexpensive, light weight and ?exible while still stiff enough to insure consistent folds. And iron on tape makes it easy to adhere them in place. But there are alternatives. Wood dowels 3/16 inch (4.76 mm) in diameter also work well. The “basic” shade that we described early in this manual has 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch wooden “battens” that are glued in place with clear silicone. Other fabric adhesives could have been used with the same results. Similarly, the relatively heavy metal rods that Sailrite offers work well in the bottom sleeve of roman shades but a thin wooden batten or dowel will work just as well in most cases.
                        The Choice of Lining Does Matter!
                        SEAMSTICK AND SPRAY ADHESIVE The intention here is to make shade assembly as error free as possible. These adhesives can be used to temporarily hold any assemblies or folds in place until a more permanent fastening is applied (usually stitches). It should be pointed out that spray adhesives tend to stiffen the assemblies which they create and this may or may not be desirable given the project at hand. The remainder of the materials list should require no comment. But let us note that the entire tools list is mostly optional. The fact is that perfectly satisfactory shades can be constructed with tools commonly available in most households.?

                        This shade will not be lined. It will make use of simple cord “lift lines” with rings. There will be ribs on alternate segments. The edges will be ?nished with a double folded hem. The ?rst order of business in a project like this is to make good use of the fabric calculator. Hit the second tab below to pull up the calculator and enter width (46 inches) and height (46 inches) and fabric width (54 inches). We will use Sunbrella Re?ex Flame Upholstery Fabric (pt # 145094-0002) so the horizontal pattern repeat is 5.6 inches and the vertical repeat is 10.15 inches.
                        !
                        Note that the edge allowance defaults to 1.5 inches. The ?at style is selected unless it is changed. The valance seed defaults to 4 inches given the length and the style of this shade (the default seed is linked to these
                        two inputs). And, ?nally, the pattern orientation defaults to length when there is a horizontal repeat. Hit “calculate”. The screen below scrolls into view. If this screen is scrolled up just a bit the entire shade rendition will be viewable.
                        !
                        Several things should be noted. First, rings are indicated only on alternate segments. Folds in a ?at shade should be formed by segment pairs rather than individual segments. The default valance seed is automatically reduced when ?at shades are selected to make this “segment pair fold” work. Second, the shade is centered over the horizontal pattern. The “centering margin” is 2.5 inches. If the fabric does not have a ?nished selvedge edge (some fabrics include extra fabric beyond the nominal published width), trim or mark it to establish that width before taking the centering measurement. Third, the length and width dimensions in yellow on the rendering include edge allowance as well as head and foot allowance. These add-ons are indicated with a lighter shade of purple. Forth, ribs are shown on each segment and listed as recommended in the list of materials. In fact ribs can be entirely absent, only on segments with rings, or on every segment as shown. Rib usage is a personal decision. Our choice is to employ them only on the alternate segments with rings. Fifth, lining fabric is included in the list of materials but it is optional. We will not be using a lining with this shade. STEP BY STEP FOR FLAT SHADES: Step 1 — Create the Shade Panels Cut the single 56 by 49 inch panel that will make this shade. Step 2 — Cut the Facing Strip Cut the bottom 6.5 inch (165.1 mm) “facing strip” from the bottom of the shade panel. Make sure that this cut is made perpendicular to the two edges and perfectly straight. Step 3 — Finish the Shade Edges Press a double fold of fabric along both edges of the shade panel. Make the ?rst fold 3/4 inch (19.05 mm) deep and do the second right on
                        top of the ?rst. Hold it all in place by running a straight stitch along the inside edges of the combined folds (about 1/8 inch or 3 mm from those inside edges). This stitch will be visible so use matching thread color and keep it straight! Step 4 — Install the Facing on the Bottom Edge With the fabric right side up, place the facing strip face down centered on the bottom of the shade panel. Baste and sew with a straight stitch across the width of the shade 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) above the aligned bottom edges. Fold the two edge allowance ?aps at the ends of the facing strip over onto the back of that strip so that they match the width of the shade. Now fold the facing strip over onto the back side of the shade and press the exposed seam edge so that it is rolled slightly to the back. Turn the assembly so the shade panel is right side down. Fold the loose edge at the top of the facing strip under until it is just 4 inches (101.6 mm) wide. Press this fold in place with an iron and then run two straight stitches across the width of the shade at the top of the facing strip. These stitches should be 1 inch (25.4 mm) apart. The weight rod will be inserted between these stitches — it will thus be 3 inches above the bottom of the shade. Step 5 — Glue Ribs in Place With the shade panel still face down, measure up from the bottom 6 inches (152.4 mm) and glue a plastic rib in place there with 5 or 6 dabs of hot glue (any glue gun will work). All the ribs should be cut 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) shorter than the width of the shade or 45.5 inches here. Proceed all the way up the rest of the shade spacing ribs on 8 inch centers (203.2 mm or twice the main segment depth — a “segment pair”). Note that we have decided to place ribs only on 5 alternate segments even though the calculator rendition shows them on every one. Step 6 — Sew Rings in Place Sew 5 rings along the bottom of alternate segments as indicated in the calculator rendition. Use a thread similar in color to the shade fabric and keep the length of the stitch on the face of the shade to a minimum in order to reduce its exposure. Measure in from the edge 1 inch (25.4 mm)
                        to place the ?rst ring. Then space the rest at 11 inch (279.4 mm) intervals across the shade. The ?nal ring should be 1 inch (25.4 mm) from the opposite edge. Repeat this for all 5 ribs. Step 7 — Install Lift Lines Insert 5 lengths of the 39 feet of leech line recommended by the calculator (any small braided cord will do), each roughly 8 feet (203.2 mm) long through the bottom rings. Secure them by sliding plastic orbs over their ends. These orbs are spring loaded to lock onto the cord while providing some measure of adjustability. Then thread each cord up through the rings above. Step 8 — Headboard Installation Prepare a headboard 46 inches long. Cover it with a scrap of material  and staple it in place as described in Chapter 8 above (if a scrap is not available, any fabric can be used). Put screw eyes in the bottom of the headboard that match the placement of the rings on the ribs. Install a small cord lock just 1 inch or so (25.4 mm) inside the right most screw eye (facing the window). Staple Velcro tape (hook or loop) on the front of the headboard. Sew the mating Velcro tape to the top of the shade after squaring and trimming it to the 46 inch height desired. Mount the headboard inside the window frame. Thread all lift lines through appropriate screw eyes and on to the cord lock. Dress the ends of the cords by using a condenser and a tassel if desired. Step 9 — Insert a Weight Rod Cut a brass weight bar with a hack saw so that it is 1.5 inches (38.1 mm) shorter than the shade width. Insert it between the two stitch lines in the facing strip at the bottom of the shade. Close the ends of the pocket with needle and thread by hand.?

                        This shade will be lined. It will make use of shroud cord “lift lines” and the shroud will be used to create the hobbles. There will be ribs on each segment in casings sewn right into the shade itself. The edges will be ?nished with a double folded hem.  The ?rst order of business in a project like this is to make good use of the fabric calculator. Hit the second tab below to pull up the calculator and enter width (46 inches) and height (46 inches) and fabric width (54 inches). We will use Sunbrella Re?ex Flame Upholstery Fabric (pt # 145094-0002) so the horizontal pattern repeat is 5.6 inches and the vertical repeat is 10.15 inches.

                        Note that the edge allowance defaults to 1.5 inches. The hobbled style is selected. The valance seed defaults to 7 inches given the length and the

Hit “calculate”. The screen below scrolls into view. If this screen is scrolled up the entire shade rendition will be viewable.
                        !
                        Several things should be noted. First, rings are not included in the material list. Instead we will be using shroud cord which makes hobbles possible without a separate cord. The calculator shows rings on every segment to indicate that there will be lift line attachment there. Folds in a hobbled shade are formed by collapsing individual segments. The default valance seed is automatically increased when hobbled shades are selected to make this “segment fold” work. Second, the shade is centered over the horizontal pattern. The “centering margin” is 2.5 inches. If the fabric does not have a ?nished selvedge edge (some fabrics include extra fabric beyond the nominal published width), trim or mark it to establish that width before taking the centering measurement. Third, the length and width dimensions in yellow on the rendering include edge allowance as well as head and foot allowance. These add-ons are indicated with a lighter shade of purple. Forth, ribs are shown on each segment and listed as recommended in the list of materials. In fact ribs can be eliminated if a softer look is desired. Rib usage is a personal decision. Our choice is to employ them. Fifth, lining fabric is included in the list of materials but it is optional. We will be using a lining with this shade. STEP BY STEP FOR HOBBLED SHADES: Step 1 — Create the Shade Panels Cut the single 94.25 by 49 inch panel that will make this shade. Also cut a single piece of lining 87.25 by 46 inches. Step 2 — Cut the Facing Strip Cut the bottom 6.5 inch (165.1 mm) “facing strip” from the bottom of the shade panel. Make sure that this cut is made perpendicular to the two edges and perfectly straight.
                        Step 3 — Secure the Lining With the decorative fabric face up, spread the lining (right side down) over it. Sew the lining in place ?rst along one edge with the two layers and the bottom  ?ush. Then smooth the fabric layers together over to the other edge until they are ?ush and sew. Be careful not to skew the lining as it is attached. Both stitches should be accurately placed 3/4 inch (19.05 mm) inside the edges. Step 4 — Finish the Edges Turn the shade assembly right side out. Press a double fold of the decorative fabric (the lining will not be folded) along both edges of the shade panel. Make the ?rst fold 3/4 inch (19.05 mm) deep and do the second right on top of the ?rst. Hold it all in place by running a straight stitch along the inside edges of the combined folds (about 1/8 inch or 3 mm from those inside edges). This stitch will be visible so use matching thread color and keep it straight! Step 5 — Finish the Facing With the fabric right side up, place the facing strip face down centered on the bottom of the shade panel. Baste and sew with a straight stitch across the width of the shade 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) above the aligned bottom edges. This stitch must be straight and 90 degrees to both edges. Fold the two edge allowance ?aps at the ends of the facing strip over onto the top of the assembly so that they match the width of the shade. Now fold the facing strip over onto the back side of the shade and press the exposed seam edge on the bottom of the shade so that it is rolled slightly to the back. Turn the assembly so the shade panel is right side down. Fold the top edge of the facing strip under until the strip itself is just 4 inches (101.6 mm) wide. Press this fold in place with an iron and then run two straight stitches across the width of the shade at the top of the facing strip. One of these  stitches should be just inside the fold of fabric and the other 1 inch (25.4 mm) down. The weight rod will be inserted in the pocket of fabric formed by these stitches — it will thus be 3 inches above the bottom of the shade.
                        Step 6 — Mark Segments and Lift Lines With the shade panel still face down, smooth the lining evenly over the decorative fabric and pin it in place every 12 inches (300 mm) or so. This is just to prevent the lining from gathering unevenly as we work with the assembly. Then put down chalk or pencil lines on the lining that represent all the lift lines and all the ribs. The 5 lift lines are at 11 inch (279.4 mm) intervals across the width of the shade with 1 inch (12.7 mm) margins at each edge. Measure from the bottom of the shade up for the rib placement. The ?rst rib is 7 inches (177.8 mm) above the bottom. All the rest (for a total of 6) are 12-3/4 inches (323.85 mm) apart. Step 7 — Fashion Shroud Cords This shade will use shroud cord to make 5 lifter lines. Divide the total length of recommended cord (39 feet) by the 5 lengths required. There will be 5 lengths 93.6 inches (2377.44 mm) long. Prepare the bottom of each shroud cord as follows. Pull the cord from the shroud 3 inches (76.2 mm) from the bottom. Cut the tape so that just 1.5 inches (38.1 mm) remains below the cord exit point. This gives us a clean edge to work with.
                        ! Now fold this tape below the cord up to create a 3/4 inch hem. Then reinforce this hem by cutting a 3 inch (76.2 mm) piece of grosgrain ribPreparing the Bottom of the Shroud Cord
                        bon, folding each end to the center and sandwiching the hem on the shroud with it.

                        !
                        Run the cord ?rst through the ring and then an adjuster orb. Repeat this process on all of the 5 lift lines.
                        Sew the Bottom Ring in Place
                        ! Step 8 — Mark Shroud Cords Lay all 5 tapes out. Starting from the rings at the bottom, measure up 6-3/8 inches(161.925 mm). Continue up the tapes at the same 6-3/8 inch interval 6 times more. An Adjuster Orb in Place
                        !
                        Step 9 — Attach Shroud Cords Starting at the rib marked 7 inches (177.8 mm) above the bottom of the shade, pin the shroud cords in place over the 5 lift line chalk marks. The center of the brass ring should be on that ?rst rib line. Then match the marks on the shroud cords at 6-3/8 inch (161.925 mm) intervals with the marks on the lining at 12-3/4 inch (323.85 mm) intervals. Pin it all together.
                        Marking Segment Intervals on the Shroud Cord
                        !
                        Then spread the shade on its width and run straight stitches from side to side on all 6 of the rib lines. The ?rst stitch at the bottom of the shade should run right through the center of the rings. Be careful with all the rest NOT to sew the cord lines. This means that you will lift the presser foot and skip over the center portion of all the tapes on rib lines above the ?rst one.
                        The Cord Mark Will be Shorter than the Rib Mark
                        !
                        Step 10 — Make Casings for Each Rib Create a casing for each rib. Place a rib centered under the seam line and insert a pin to hold it snugly in place.
                        !  Remove the rib and measure the distance from the seam line to the pin. Fold the shade on each of the rib lines and run a row of straight

                        stitches just that distance from the fold. Be careful to avoid stitching through the lift lines — move them out of the way or skip over them . The latter will be the general rule.
                        !
                        !
                        Skip Over the Shroud Cords
                        Shroud Tape Secured Only at Rib Stitch
                        Step 11 — Cut and Insert Ribs The ribs should be 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) less than the width of the shade or 45.5 inches (1155.7 mm) here. Sew the rib casings shut with   needle and thread by hand.
                        Step 12 — Finish the Top of the Shade The top hobble will not be sewn in place at this point. Fold it over the segment just below so that it matches all the folds below. Measure up from the bottom 46 inches (1168.4 mm) and put a straight chalk line at that point across the width of the shade. The lining is not yet fastened to the decorative fabric at the top so carefully pin it in place and run a row of stitches the thickness of the headboard on its front edge, 3/4 inch (19.05 mm) in our case, above the chalk line before moving on. Cut on this line. Do not sew over the lift lines or cut them.
                        !
                        Fold the decorative fabric on the chalk line over onto the back of the shade. Place either the hook or the loop side of the Velcro tape over this hem and pin everything in place. Sew with straight stitches along both edges and the ends of the tape. Again, keep all the tapes out from under the machine as these stitches are applied.

                        Step 13 — The Headboard Prepare a headboard 46 inches long. Cover it with a scrap of material  and staple it in place as described in Chapter 8 above (if a scrap is not available, any fabric can be used or the board can be left bare — it will not be visible).

                        The Velcro Tape Pinned in Place
                        where they will be secured to the headboard. Leave the cord intact but cut the shroud so that it is just 3 inches (76.2 mm) beyond the exit point.
                        ! Fold the 3 inches over until there are 4 layers about 3/4 inch (19.05 mm) beyond the cord. Staple this so the black dots on the shroud are centered on the bottom edge of the headboard. Put a screw eye in the center of the stapled shroud. Repeat this process for all 5 lift lines. Pick the Cord Out of the Shroud at the Headboard and Shorten the Shroud
                        !
                        Thread all cords through the screw eyes at their head and all the eyes to the right (or the left if it is preferred that the lift lines be worked from that side). Insert the lines into a small cord lock and screw it in place just 1 inch or so  (25.4 mm) inside the screw eye on the selected side. Dress the ends of the cords by using a condenser and a tassel if desired.
                        Staple the Shroud to the Headboard Bottom and Install Screw Eye

Insert it between the two stitch lines in the facing strip at the bottom of the shade. Close the ends of the pocket with needle and thread by hand.?

                    <div style="padding:1em">
                        This shade will be lined. It will make use of simple cord “lift lines” with rings. There will be ribs on each segment in casings sewn right into the shade itself. The edges will be ?nished with a double folded hem. The ?rst order of business in a project like this is to make good use of the fabric calculator. Hit the second tab below to pull up the calculator and enter width (46 inches) and height (46 inches) and fabric width (54 inches). We will use Sunbrella Re?ex Flame Upholstery Fabric (pt # 145094-0002) so the horizontal pattern repeat is 5.6 inches and the vertical repeat is 10.15 inches.
                        !
                        Note that the edge allowance defaults to 1.5 inches. The slatted style is selected. The valance seed defaults to 7 inches given the length and the style of this shade (the default seed is linked to these two inputs). And, ?
                        nally, the pattern orientation defaults to length when there is a horizontal repeat. Hit “calculate”. The screen below scrolls into view. If this screen is scrolled up the entire shade rendition will be viewable.
                        !
                        Several things should be noted. First, rings are indicated on all segments. Folds in a slatted shade are formed by collapsing individual segments. The default valance seed is automatically increased when slatted shades are selected to make this “segment fold” work. Second, the shade is centered over the horizontal pattern. The “centering margin” is 2.5 inches. If the fabric does not have a ?nished selvedge edge (some fabrics include extra fabric beyond the nominal published width), trim or mark it to establish that width before taking the centering measurement. Third, the length and width dimensions in yellow on the rendering include edge allowance as well as head and foot allowance. These add-ons are indicated with a lighter shade of purple. Forth, ribs are shown on each segment and listed as recommended in the list of materials. Slatted shades require ribs roughly 1-3/8 inches (34.925 mm) wide. This width could easily be changed if desired, but the calculator’s yardage required would have to be increased to accommodate the deeper pockets. Fifth, lining fabric is included in the list of materials but it is optional. We will be using a lining with this shade. STEP BY STEP FOR SLATTED SHADES: Step 1 — Create the Shade Panels Cut the single 74 by 49 inch panel that will make this shade. Also cut a single piece of lining 67 by 46 inches. Step 2 — Cut the Facing Strip Cut the bottom 6.5 inch (165.1 mm) “facing strip” from the bottom of the shade panel. Make sure that this cut is made perpendicular to the two edges and perfectly straight. Step 3 — Secure the Lining With the decorative fabric face up, spread the lining (right side down) over it. Sew the lining in place ?rst along one edge with the two layers and the bottom  ?ush. Then smooth the fabric layers together over to the
                        other edge until they are ?ush and sew. Be careful not to skew the lining as it is attached. Both stitches should be accurately placed 3/4 inch (19.05 mm) inside the edges. Step 4 — Finish the Edges Turn the shade assembly right side out. Press a double fold of the decorative fabric (the lining will not be folded) along both edges of the shade panel. Make the ?rst fold 3/4 inch (19.05 mm) deep and do the second right on top of the ?rst. Hold it all in place by running a straight stitch along the inside edges of the combined folds (about 1/8 inch or 3 mm from those inside edges). This stitch will be visible so use matching thread color and keep it straight! Step 5 — Finish the Facing With the fabric right side up, place the facing strip face down centered on the bottom of the shade panel. Baste and sew with a straight stitch across the width of the shade 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) above the aligned bottom edges. This stitch must be straight and 90 degrees to both edges. Fold the two edge allowance ?aps at the ends of the facing strip over onto the top of the assembly so that they match the width of the shade. Now fold the facing strip over onto the back side of the shade and press the exposed seam edge on the bottom of the shade so that it is rolled slightly to the back. Turn the assembly so the shade panel is right side down. Fold the top edge of the facing strip under until the strip itself is just 4 inches (101.6 mm) wide. Press this fold in place with an iron and then run two straight stitches across the width of the shade at the top of the facing strip. One of these stitches should be just inside the fold of fabric and the other 1 inch (25.4 mm) down. The weight rod will be inserted in the pocket of fabric formed by these stitches — it will thus be 3 inches above the bottom of the shade. Step 6 — Mark Segment Tops With the shade panel still face down, smooth the lining evenly over the decorative fabric and pin it in place every 12 inches (300 mm) or so. This is just to prevent the lining from gathering unevenly as we work with the assembly. Then turn the assembly over so the shade is face up.
                        Put down chalk lines on the decorative fabric that represent the top of each segment including 1/2 of the fabric outlined in yellow on the calculator rendition. Measure from the bottom of the shade up. The ?rst horizontal line will be 7 + 1-1/2 inches (254 mm) above the bottom. All the rest (for a total of 6) are 9-3/8 inches (212.725 mm) apart. Step 7 — Sew Slat Pockets Turn the assembly over once again so the lining is up. Working from the bottom of the shade, fold it on the ?rst chalk line so the lining sides are together. Keep the lining and the ornamental fabric smoothly together. Pin carefully 1-1/2 inches (38.1 mm) inside the fold and run a row of straight stitches all the way across the shade. Repeat this process on each chalk line all the way to the top of the shade. Then lay the assembly right side up and press each pocket toward the bottom of the shade. The 5 lift lines are at 11 inch (279.4 mm) intervals across the width of the shade with 1 inch (12.7 mm) margins at each edge. Step 8 — Sew Rings in Place Sew 5 rings along the top of each rib pocket as indicated in the calculator rendition. Use a thread similar in color to the shade fabric and keep the length of the stitch on the face of the shade to a minimum in order to reduce its exposure. Measure in from the edge 1 inch (25.4 mm) to place the ?rst ring. Then space the rest at 11 inch (279.4 mm) intervals across the shade. The ?nal ring should be 1 inch (25.4 mm) from the opposite edge. Repeat this for all 6 ribs. Step 8 — Install Lift Lines Insert 5 lengths of the 39 feet of leech line recommended by the calculator (any small braided cord will do), each roughly 8 feet (203.2 mm) long through the bottom rings. Secure them by sliding plastic orbs over their ends. These orbs are spring loaded to lock onto the cord while providing some measure of adjustability. Then thread each cord up through the rings above.
                        Step 8 — Headboard Installation Prepare a headboard 46 inches long. Cover it with a scrap of material  and staple it in place as described in Chapter 8 above (if a scrap is not available, any fabric can be used). Put screw eyes in the bottom of the headboard that match the placement of the rings on the ribs. Install a small cord lock just 1 inch or so (25.4 mm) inside one of the outside screw eyes. Staple Velcro tape (hook or loop) on the front of the headboard. Sew the mating Velcro tape to the top of the shade after squaring and trimming it to the 46 inch height desired. Mount the headboard inside the window frame. Thread all lift lines through appropriate screw eyes and on to the cord lock. Dress the ends of the cords by using a condenser and a tassel if desired. Step 9 — Insert a Weight Rod and Ribs Cut a brass weight bar with a hack saw so that it is 1.5 inches (38.1 mm) shorter than the shade width (44.5 inches here). Insert it between the two stitch lines in the facing strip at the bottom of the shade. Close the ends of the pocket with needle and thread by hand. Make 6 ribs 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) shorter than the shade’s width (45.5 inches). Insert them in the pockets and sew those pockets shut just as above.

                        This shade will be lined using a spray adhesive. It will make use of simple cord “lift lines” with rings. There will be no ribs. The edges will be ?nished with a double folded hem. The ?rst order of business in a project like this is to make good use of the fabric calculator. Hit the second tab below to pull up the calculator and enter width (46 inches) and height (46 inches) and fabric width (54 inches). We will use Sunbrella Re?ex Flame Upholstery Fabric (pt # 145094-0002) so the horizontal pattern repeat is 5.6 inches and the vertical repeat is 10.15 inches.
                        !
                        Note that the edge allowance defaults to 1.5 inches. The tucked style is selected. The valance seed defaults to 4 inches given the length and the style of this shade (the default seed is linked by default to these two in
                        puts). And, ?nally, the pattern orientation defaults to length when there is a horizontal repeat. Hit “calculate”. The screen below scrolls into view. If this screen is scrolled up just a bit the entire shade rendition will be viewable.
                        !
                        Several things should be noted. First, rings are indicated only on alternate segments. Folds in a tucked shade should be formed by segment pairs rather than individual segments. The default valance seed is automatically reduced when tucked shades are selected to make this “segment pair fold” work. Second, the shade is centered over the horizontal pattern. The “centering margin” is 2.5 inches. If the fabric does not have a ?nished selvedge edge (some fabrics include extra fabric beyond the nominal published width), trim or mark it to establish that width before taking the centering measurement. Third, the length and width dimensions in yellow on the rendering include edge allowance as well as head and foot allowance. These add-ons are indicated with a lighter shade of purple. Forth, ribs are not shown on the rendition. They could be used here but we assume that tucked shades will normally be selected when it is intended that the shade will fold very ?at like an accordion. Ribs would tend to add bulk to such a fold. The yellow boxes on the rendition are the fabric “add ons” to make the tucks — not ribs. Fifth, lining fabric is included in the list of materials. It is optional but we will add a lining to our shade. We will be using a spray adhesive to attach the lining to the face fabric here. This will make the shade stiffer than might otherwise be desired but that stiffness contributes to the smooth and tailored look that is often sought after with this type of shade.
                        STEP BY STEP FOR TUCKED SHADES: Step 1 — Create the Shade Panels Cut the single 63.5 by 49 inch panel that will make this shade. Also cut a lining panel 56.5 by 46 inches.
                        Step 2 — Secure the Lining Lay the face panel right side up on a table. Put the lining wrong side up (if there is a “wrong” side) over it and make one side and the top edges ?ush (as shown in the picture below). Use Seamstick or pin the two layers together at intervals of 6 to 12 inches (150 to 300 mm) or so all along the side making sure that the fabric layers are ?at. Then roll the basted side over and stretch the liner out ?at until it is ?ush with the second side of the shade. Seamstick or pin this second edge just like the ?rst. Note that if the facing and the liner have not been cut straight and square, they may not match along the top of the shade — this is OK so long as it does not exceed a couple of inches or so since the calculator allows an extra 3 inches (76.2 mm) at the top that is meant for just such eventualities.
                        ! Run a row of straight stitches (make the stitch length on the machine maximum) all along the ?ush edges. This stitch should be exactly 3/4 inch (19 mm) inside those edges. It is a good idea here to use something like the Deluxe Magnetic Guide on the machine to keep this stitch consistently positioned all along its length. If pins are used, you may want to remove them as they are encountered although they generally cause no trouble when sewn right over. Always backstitch for an inch or so at the beginning and end of all stitch lines to lock them in place. Making the Second Edge Flush
                        ! With everything still wrong side out and lining side up, use a “safely” hot iron to press the 3/4 inch (19.05 mm) width of lining ?at against the decorative fabric on both sides. Do not crease the fold in the decorative fabric on the outer edge of the shade. Step 3 — Finish the Edges Lightly spray the lining with an adhesive (3M’s Super 77 is a good choice). Turn the shade assembly right side out and smooth the two panels together. The lining should be ?at and centered on the decorative fabric. Press a double fold of the decorative fabric (the lining will not be folded) along both edges of the shade panel. Make the ?rst fold 3/4 inch (19.05 mm) deep and do the second right on top of the ?rst (this fold will also be over the lining). Press this assembly ?at all along both edges of the shade. These hems will not require stitching if there are rings or ribs or pockets at intervals. But a single line of straight stitches along the inner side of each hem will ensure that everything stays in place. This stitch will be visible so use matching thread color and keep it straight! Pressing the Lining Over the Facing
                        ! Step 4 — Cut and Attach the Facing Strip Cut the bottom 6.5 inch (165.1 mm) “facing strip” from the bottom of the shade panel. Make sure that this cut is made perpendicular to the two edges and perfectly straight. Note that there will be 1/2 inch of decorative fabric below the liner. This is seam allowance used to secure the facing strip in place.
                        !
                        Creating the Final Folds in the Shade Edge
                        Squaring the Shade Bottom Edge
                        With the fabric right side up, place the facing strip face down centered underneath the bottom of the shade panel (with lining side up).
                        ! Baste and sew with a straight stitch across the width of the shade 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) above the aligned bottom edges. Fold the two edge allowance ?aps at the ends of the facing strip under onto the back of the strip so that strip matches the width of the shade. Now fold the facing strip over onto the back side of the shade and press the exposed seam edge so that it is rolled slightly to the back. Turn the assembly so the shade panel is right side down. Fold the loose edge at the top of the facing strip under until it is just 4 inches (101.6 mm) wide. Press this fold in place with an iron and then run two straight stitches across the width of the shade at the top of the facing strip. These stitches should be 1 inch (25.4 mm) apart. The weight rod will be inserted between these stitches — it will thus be 3 inches above the bottom of the shade. Position the Facing Strip
                        ! Step 6 — Mark Segment Tops Turn the assembly over so the shade is face up. Put down chalk lines on the decorative fabric that represent the top of each segment including 1/2 of the fabric outlined in yellow on the calculator rendition. Measure from the bottom of the shade up. The ?rst horizontal line will be 6 + 3/8 inches (161.925 mm) above the bottom. All the rest (for a total of 11) are 4-3/8 inches (111.125 mm) apart. Step 7 — Sew Tucks Turn the assembly over once again so the lining is down. Working from the bottom of the shade, fold it on the ?rst chalk line so the decorative sides are together. Keep the lining and the ornamental fabric smoothly together. Press and pin carefully 3/8 inches (9.525 mm) inside the fold and run a row of straight stitches all the way across the shade. The ?rst stitch line is on the lining fabric. The next fold bring the lining sides together, press and pin, and then sew on the decorative fabric. Alternate like this on each chalk line all the way to the top of the shade. The 5 lift lines are at 11 inch (279.4 mm) intervals across the width of the shade with 1 inch (12.7 mm) margins at each edge. Step 8 — Sew Rings in Place Sew 5 rings along the top of each lining tuck edge as indicated in the calculator rendition. Use a thread similar in color to the shade fabric and The Bottom Weight Bar Facing
                        keep the length of the stitch on the face of the shade to a minimum in order to reduce its exposure. Measure in from the edge 1 inch (25.4 mm) to place the ?rst ring. Then space the rest at 11 inch (279.4 mm) intervals across the shade. The ?nal ring should be 1 inch (25.4 mm) from the opposite edge. Repeat this for all 5 lining tuck edges. Step 8 — Install Lift Lines Insert 5 lengths of the 39 feet of leech line recommended by the calculator (any small braided cord will do), each roughly 8 feet (203.2 mm) long through the bottom rings. Secure them by sliding plastic orbs over their ends. These orbs are spring loaded to lock onto the cord while providing some measure of adjustability. Then thread each cord up through the rings above. Step 8 — Headboard Installation Prepare a headboard 46 inches long. Cover it with a scrap of material  and staple it in place as described in Chapter 8 above (if a scrap is not available, any fabric can be used). Put screw eyes in the bottom of the headboard that match the placement of the rings on the ribs. Install a small cord lock just 1 inch or so (25.4 mm) inside one of the outside screw eyes. Staple Velcro tape (hook or loop) on the front of the headboard. Sew the mating Velcro tape to the top of the shade after squaring and trimming it to the 46 inch height desired. Mount the headboard inside the window frame. Thread all lift lines through appropriate screw eyes and on to the cord lock. Dress the ends of the cords by using a condenser and a tassel if desired. Step 9 — Insert a Weight Rod and Ribs Cut a brass weight bar with a hack saw so that it is 1.5 inches (38.1 mm) shorter than the shade width (44.5 inches here). Insert it between the two stitch lines in the facing strip at the bottom of the shade. Close the ends of the pocket with needle and thread by hand. Make 6 ribs 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) shorter than the shade’s width (45.5 inches). Insert them in the pockets and sew those pockets shut just as above.
